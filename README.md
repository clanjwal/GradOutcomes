# GradOutcomes: Predicting Graduation Outcomes in New York City
This repository contains the code and some analysis performed on a dataset containing information regarding graduation outcomes in New York City from the years 2005-2010. This is my first data science project in which I used a linear regression model to predict how a school's demographic affects graduation outcomes. I picked this dataset because growing up in a diverse part of New Jersey, I have witnessed how different demographics have been impacted by the education system. Before delving into my research and analysis, I figured that the impact in New York City would be exacerbated as the schooling is more competitive, even with awarding students different levels of diplomas. By researching and becoming more aware of the inequality in schooling, we can create a better learning experiences for schools that may be underperforming. 

This project has introduced me to the benefits, as well as the limitations, of the linear regression model.

**Description of the Dataset**
---
The following information can be found in the file, but I will also include it here for a brief overview of the dataset. Each row represents a school's graduation outcome for a specific year, indicating how many students have graduated, the types of diplomas students have received, and how many students have dropped out or are still enrolled in the school.

Some background information is necessary to further understand what certain values and columns mean. Students can graduate with one of the following three diplomas:

Local Diploma: The local diploma is awarded to students who have completed the minimum requirements for high school graduation, but have not met the requirements for a Regents Diploma. Students must complete a certain number of credits in required subjects such as English, math, science, social studies, and physical education.

Regents Diploma: The Regents Diploma is a more rigorous diploma option that requires students to meet specific academic standards. To earn a Regents Diploma, students must complete a set number of required credits in core subjects as well as pass corresponding Regents exams in those subjects. These exams typically include English Language Arts, mathematics, science, and social studies.

Advanced Regents Diploma: The Advanced Regents Diploma is an even more demanding diploma option that signifies a higher level of academic achievement. In addition to meeting the requirements for a Regents Diploma, students pursuing an Advanced Regents Diploma must complete additional coursework and pass more rigorous Regents exams. The additional coursework for an Advanced Regents Diploma often includes advanced math and science courses, additional credits in languages other than English, and completion of a Regents exam in a language other than English.

Further information about the columns of the dataset can be found in my project file.
